# Recipe highlighting

This project is to explore the concept of syntax highlighting with recipes.

Currently it's just a set of experimental python scripts but the final form will ideally be a workable GoogleDocs plugin/app that can update/revise/parse google-docs and even import new recipes from arbitrary text/urls etc.
